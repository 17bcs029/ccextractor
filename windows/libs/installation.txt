In order to compile CCExtractor with OCR support (the (Release|Debug)-OCR configurations), 
we need the header files and .lib files for two libraries: Tesseract and Leptonica.

The project expects the following directory structure:

leptonica
	-> include
		 * library header files which leptonica depends on (gif_lib, zlib, png, ...)
		-> leptonica
			* leptonica headers (most importantly allheaders.h)
	-> lib
		 * the .lib & .dll generated by compiling Leptonica
tesseract
	-> include
		-> tesseract
			* tesseract headers (most importantly capi.h)
	-> lib
			* the .lib & .dll generated by compiling Tesseract


Currently CCExtractor makes use of liblept168 (Leptonica 1.68) and libtesseract302 (Tesseract 3.02).
