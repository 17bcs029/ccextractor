How to compile ccextractor  on linux with OCR
=============================================

Download and Install Leptonnica.
-------------------------------
This package is available, you need liblept-devel library.

If Leptonica isn't available for your distribution, or you want to use a newer version
 than they offer, you can compile your own.

you can download lib leptonica from  http://www.leptonica.com/download.html

Download and Install Tesseract.
-------------------------------
Tesseract is available directly from many Linux distributions. The package is generally
 called 'tesseract' or 'tesseract-ocr' - search your distribution's repositories to
 find it. Packages are also generally available for language training data (search the
 repositories,) but if not you will need to download the appropriate training data,
 unpack it, and copy the .traineddata file into the 'tessdata' directory, probably
 /usr/share/tesseract-ocr/tessdata or /usr/share/tessdata.

If Tesseract isn't available for your distribution, or you want to use a newer version
 than they offer, you can compile your own.

If you compile Tesseract then following command in its source code are enough
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

 Note: 
1) CCExtractor is tested with Tesseract 3.02.02 version.

Compile CCextractor passing flags like following
-------------------------------------------------
make ENABLE_OCR=yes
