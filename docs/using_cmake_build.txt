For building ccextractor using cmake folllow below steps..

Step 1) Check you have right version of cmake installed. ( version >= 3.0.2 )
	We are using CMP0037 policy of cmake which was introduced in 3.0.0
	since we have tested our system only with cmake version 3.0.2, I would
	suggest to use 3.0.2 or higher version.


Step 2) create a seprate directory where you want to build the target.
	In Unix you can do it using follwing commands.
	~> cd ccextractor
	~> mkdir build

Step 3) make the build sytem using cmake
	~> cmake ../src/

Step 4) Compile the code.
	~> make
	~> make install

Step 5) Use CCextractor as you would like
